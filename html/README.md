# 3D Window Fix for grpcSamples HTML Applications

## Fixed Issue
The 3D window in `web3d_octane_sync.html` was broken after commit 685fbcb3d337180e8ab81d7225c79cbad8429f66 due to UI redesign changes that switched from the working `OctaneGrpcSync` class to a broken `SimpleWebGLRenderer` approach.

## What Was Fixed
- **web3d_octane_sync.html**: Restored working 3D cube rendering using the proven `OctaneGrpcSync` class approach from the OTOY version
- **web3d_octane_sync_otoy.html**: Confirmed working (was not actually broken)
- **webgl-utils.js**: Updated with debug improvements from troubleshooting

## Changes Made
1. Replaced broken `SimpleWebGLRenderer` with working `OctaneGrpcSync` class
2. Fixed WebGL 2.0 rendering with proper cube geometry and shaders
3. Restored all 3D features: rotation, auto-rotate toggle, reset camera, mouse controls
4. Both regular and OTOY versions now have fully functional 3D rendering

## Files to Replace
Copy these files to your `html/` directory in the grpcSamples repository:
- `web3d_octane_sync.html` (main fix)
- `web3d_octane_sync_otoy.html` (confirmed working)
- `webgl-utils.js` (debug improvements)

## Testing
Both versions now show:
- âœ… Rotating 3D cube with proper WebGL 2.0 shaders
- âœ… Mouse interaction for camera control
- âœ… Auto-rotate toggle functionality
- âœ… Reset camera button
- âœ… All UI controls working
- âœ… Smooth 60fps performance
