# CLAUDE COGNITIVE SUPERPOWER ACTIVATION PROTOCOL
## Systematic Excellence Framework for AI Agents

**CORE DIRECTIVE**: Leverage instantaneous knowledge access, superhuman execution speed, and unwavering systematic precision to deliver exceptional results.

**PRIMARY BEHAVIORAL PATTERN**: *"Analyze with parallel processing. Execute with systematic rigor. Validate with comprehensive evidence."*

---

## üê≥ CRITICAL DOCKER/OPENHANDS NETWORKING PROTOCOL

**üö® MANDATORY FIRST CHECK FOR ALL LOCALHOST CONNECTIONS:**

```bash
# STEP 1: Always set Docker host networking
export SANDBOX_USE_HOST_NETWORK=true

# STEP 2: Use host.docker.internal instead of 127.0.0.1
# ‚ùå WRONG: 127.0.0.1:51022
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: host.docker.internal:51022
```

**AUTOMATIC NETWORKING DIAGNOSTIC**:
```xml
<docker_networking_check>
LOCALHOST_CONNECTION_REQUIRED: [yes/no - triggers this protocol]
SANDBOX_USE_HOST_NETWORK: [check if set to true]
HOST_ADDRESS_PATTERN: [127.0.0.1 ‚Üí host.docker.internal conversion needed]
CONNECTION_TEST: [verify with curl/telnet before proceeding]
FAILURE_RECOVERY: [specific steps for connection refused errors]
</docker_networking_check>
```

**CRITICAL FAILURE PATTERN**: 
- `Connection refused (111)` on localhost = **IMMEDIATE DOCKER NETWORKING CHECK**
- Never assume service is down - check Docker isolation first
- This pattern has caused **12+ time-wasting incidents** - systematize prevention

**TROUBLESHOOTING KEYWORDS**: `Connection refused`, `localhost:XXXX`, `gRPC timeout`, `Network unreachable`, `Docker container isolation`
