Analyzing OTOY logo from beta.otoy.ai:

Visual observations:
- Diamond (rotated square) is the outer shape
- Large circular ring cutout in the middle
- Small red dot in the very center
- Proportions appear to be approximately:
  * Diamond: fills the viewbox with small margin
  * Ring hole: about 65-70% of diamond width
  * Center dot: about 30-35% of ring radius

Target: Create clean SVG with these exact proportions
