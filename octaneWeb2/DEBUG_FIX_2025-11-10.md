# Debug Fix - Module Import Error

**Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Error:** `Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module does not provide an export named 'ObjectType'`

## Problem Description

The application was failing to load with the following error in the browser:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/@fs/C:/otoyla/GRPC/dev/grpcSamples/octaneWeb2/src/constants/OctaneTypes.js' 
does not provide an export named 'ObjectType' (at octaneClient.ts:1:10)
```

## Root Cause

There were **two files** in the `src/constants/` directory:

1. **`octaneTypes.ts`** (TypeScript) - Properly exports `ObjectType` as an ES module:
   ```typescript
   export const ObjectType = { ... }
   ```

2. **`OctaneTypes.js`** (JavaScript) - Legacy file that only sets window globals:
   ```javascript
   window.OctaneTypes.ObjectType = { ... }
   ```

When `octaneClient.ts` tried to import from `'../constants/octaneTypes'`, the module resolver was finding `OctaneTypes.js` instead of `octaneTypes.ts` (likely due to case-insensitivity on Windows). Since `OctaneTypes.js` doesn't export anything (it only sets `window.OctaneTypes`), the import failed.

## Solution

**Renamed the conflicting file:**
```bash
mv src/constants/OctaneTypes.js src/constants/OctaneTypes.js.backup
```

This ensures that imports resolve to the correct TypeScript file (`octaneTypes.ts`).

## Files Affected

- ✅ `src/constants/OctaneTypes.js` → `src/constants/OctaneTypes.js.backup` (renamed)
- ✅ `src/api/octaneClient.ts` (no changes needed - import already correct)
- ✅ `src/components/panels/SceneOutliner.tsx` (no changes needed - import already correct)

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:42219 in your browser
4. The error should be gone and the app should load correctly

## Additional Notes

- The `OctaneTypes.js.backup` file is kept for reference but is not used by the application
- If you need the legacy window globals approach, you could restore it, but you'd need to either:
  - Load it as a `<script>` tag in index.html (not recommended for modern apps)
  - Add proper ES module exports to it
  - Use a different filename to avoid conflicts
