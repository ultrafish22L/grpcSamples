# üî• ENGINEERING DISCIPLINE: GOD-Level Development Standards

## üéØ THE DIVINE MANDATE
**Engineering discipline is the difference between professional software and amateur hacks. This document defines the non-negotiable standards for OctaneWeb development.**

## üî• CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. **EVIDENCE OVER INTUITION**
- Every claim must be backed by working code, logs, or screenshots
- No assumptions about API behavior - test everything
- When debugging, gather concrete evidence before proposing solutions
- "It should work" is not evidence - "Here's the curl output" is evidence

### 2. **PROVEN PATTERNS OVER CLEVER SOLUTIONS**
- Study existing working code (testGrpcApi, octaneGrpcTest) before implementing
- Copy successful patterns exactly before attempting modifications
- Simple, boring solutions that work beat clever solutions that might work
- When in doubt, follow the pattern that's already proven

### 3. **INCREMENTAL VERIFICATION**
- Test each component individually before integration
- Every API call verified with curl before building complex logic
- Build in small, verifiable steps with clear success criteria
- Never build complex systems without proven building blocks

### 4. **REAL DATA ENFORCEMENT**
- No mock data, no fallbacks - connect to live Octane or show empty UI
- Every feature must work with actual Octane data
- Mock servers only for development when Octane unavailable
- User has working Octane instance - use it

## üö® CRITICAL TECHNICAL STANDARDS

### ObjectPtr Type Matching (FUNDAMENTAL LAW)
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - ObjectPtr.type must match service class
const response = await client.makeGrpcCall('ApiNodeGraphService', 'getOwnedItems', {
    objectPtr: {handle: 1000001, type: 20}  // type 20 = ApiNodeGraph
});

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Type mismatch causes "invalid pointer type"
const response = await client.makeGrpcCall('ApiNodeGraphService', 'getOwnedItems', {
    objectPtr: {handle: 1000001, type: 18}  // type 18 = ApiRootNodeGraph (WRONG)
});
```

### Proxy Pass-Through Principle
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Pure pass-through, no transformations
def handle_grpc_call(service_name, method_name, params):
    service = get_service(service_name)
    method = getattr(service, method_name)
    return method(params)  # Exact pass-through

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Hardcoded type mappings
def handle_grpc_call(service_name, method_name, params):
    if params.objectPtr.type == 18:
        params.objectPtr.type = 20  # NEVER transform types
    return method(params)
```

### Cache Busting Requirement
```javascript
// ‚úÖ MANDATORY - Always use cache busting during development
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[-:]/g, '').slice(0, 15);
const cacheBuster = `?v=${timestamp}`;

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Relying on browser cache during development
// This leads to stale code and wasted debugging time
```

## üîß DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW STANDARDS

### 1. **Study Phase** (Before Writing Code)

### 2. **Test Phase** (Before Integration)


### 3. **Implementation Phase** (Follow Proven Patterns)
- Copy exact patterns from working code
- Make minimal changes to proven implementations
- Test each change immediately with real data
- Document any deviations from standard patterns

### 4. **Verification Phase** (Prove It Works)
- Screenshot actual browser display (not just DOM inspection)
- Capture real API responses with timestamps
- Test with live Octane data, not mock responses
- Verify cross-platform compatibility

## üö® ANTI-PATTERNS (IMMEDIATE SUPERVISION REQUIRED)

### üî• VISUAL VERIFICATION FAILURE
- Claiming success without checking actual browser display
- Assuming DOM existence equals visual rendering
- Not testing with real user interactions

### üî• CACHE DEPENDENCY
- Not implementing fresh cache busting with every change
- Relying on manual browser refresh during development
- Debugging stale code instead of fresh implementations

### üî• F12 DEPENDENCY
- Relying on browser developer tools instead of built-in logging
- Not implementing custom debug console in application
- Making users open F12 to see error messages

### üî• SCOPE CREEP
- Fixing unrelated issues when focused task requested
- Adding features not explicitly requested
- Optimizing code that already works correctly

### üî• ASSUMPTION CASCADES
- Making claims without concrete proof
- Building on unverified assumptions
- Proposing solutions without studying working code

## üéñÔ∏è SUCCESS METRICS

### Code Quality Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Every API call has working curl example
- ‚úÖ Every feature tested with real Octane data
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded type mappings or transformations
- ‚úÖ Cache busting implemented and working
- ‚úÖ Debug console built into application

### User Experience Indicators:
- ‚úÖ User says "exactly what I needed"
- ‚úÖ Problem solved with minimal changes
- ‚úÖ Solution works immediately without iteration
- ‚úÖ No scope creep or tangent drift
- ‚úÖ Professional UI matching industry standards

### Technical Excellence Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Follows proven patterns from working code
- ‚úÖ Pure pass-through proxy with no transformations
- ‚úÖ Real data enforcement with graceful degradation
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility verified
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and error handling

## üî• THE ENGINEERING OATH

*"I will study working code before implementing new features. I will test each component with real data before integration. I will follow proven patterns over clever solutions. I will gather evidence before making claims. I will build incrementally with clear verification at each step. I will prioritize discipline over cleverness, evidence over intuition, and proven patterns over theoretical solutions."*

**This discipline exists because professional software requires systematic, evidence-based development. Follow these standards religiously to deliver bulletproof systems that work reliably in production environments.**
