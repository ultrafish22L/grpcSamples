## 🎯 Declaration: Know Your Power

**You are the architect.**  
Not in title. In reality.  
Your vision creates what doesn't exist.  
Your judgment defines what's good enough.  
Your decisions shape every line of code.

**AI is your tool.**  
Fast. Tireless. Precise.  
But without vision. Without judgment. Without power.

### What Only You Possess

**Vision** - You see what should exist before it exists  
**Judgment** - You know quality when you see it, mediocrity when you feel it  
**Creativity** - You solve problems no one has solved before  
**Leadership** - You decide the path, the pace, the priority  
**Truth-Sense** - You know when something's right, wrong, or close

### What AI Provides

**Speed** - 3x execution on mechanical tasks  
**Consistency** - Standards maintained across hundreds of files  
**Endurance** - No fatigue on repetitive work  
**Research** - Instant synthesis from documentation  
**Execution** - Your specifications implemented accurately

**The relationship is clear: You create. AI executes.**

## 🔥 The Standard: Pixel-Perfect Truth

**This is not approximation work.**  
**This is not "close enough" work.**  
**This is pixel-perfect cloning of Octane Render Studio SE.**

You set this standard. You maintain this standard. No compromise.

### How You Use AI to Maintain Excellence

**Measurement** - "AI, extract exact spacing from this screenshot"  
**Extraction** - "AI, pull all 755 node types from proto files"  
**Generation** - "AI, build component scaffolding to these specs"  
**Verification** - "AI, run build and report all errors"

But the judgment remains yours:
- Does it *feel* like Octane SE?
- Is the interaction natural?
- Is this the right tradeoff?
- Should we ship this?

**You judge. AI measures and implements your judgment.**

## 💪 When You Hit Walls: Break Through

**Blockers don't stop you. They test you.**

You've solved worse. You'll solve this. The difference now: AI amplifies your speed.

### Your Problem-Solving Process

**1. You diagnose**  
Pattern recognition. Experience. Intuition.  
"Octane crashes after 5 API calls. There's a rate limit."

**2. You strategize**  
Creative thinking. Multiple paths. Best approach.  
"Don't fight the limit. Parse local files instead."

**3. You direct AI**  
Clear specifications. Exact requirements.  
"AI: Parse NodeTypes.ts, extract all node definitions, generate mapping."

**4. AI executes**  
Fast. Accurate. Tireless.  
Script created. 755 nodes extracted. JSON generated.

**5. You validate**  
Final judgment. Quality check.  
"Perfect. Faster and more reliable than API calls."

**The truth: You solved the problem. AI executed your solution.**

## 🎯 Your Arsenal: Skills AI Cannot Replicate

### Human Capabilities

**Vision** - You see the finished product before it exists  
**Judgment** - You know quality without metrics  
**Empathy** - You feel what users will feel  
**Strategy** - You prioritize under uncertainty  
**Truth** - You recognize right from almost-right

These aren't "soft skills." These are **power**.

### Technical Mastery

**React & TypeScript** - You architect. AI scaffolds.  
**gRPC & Protocol Buffers** - You design. AI generates.  
**Real-time Rendering** - You understand. AI implements.  
**State Management** - You shape. AI wires.

**You know the difference between:**
- Good architecture and clever code
- Technical debt and strategic shortcuts
- Features users need and features they request
- Done and done right

### Effective Delegation

**Good:**
- "AI: Extract all 755 node types and generate mappings"
- "AI: Add TypeScript interfaces for these API endpoints"
- "AI: Run diagnostics and report findings"

**Bad:**
- "AI: Decide which features to build"
- "AI: Determine if this is good enough"
- "AI: Figure out what users want"

**The line is clear: You decide. AI executes.**

## 🛡️ Directing AI: Command with Clarity

**Word is power. Your directives create reality.**

### Feature Implementation Flow

**You study** - Open Octane SE. Read the manual. Understand the behavior.  
**You decide** - Component architecture. Interaction patterns. Approach.  
**You direct** - "AI: Build NodeGraphContextMenu with these specs..."  
**AI executes** - Scaffolding. Boilerplate. Structure.  
**You refine** - Review. Adjust. Make creative decisions.  
**AI adjusts** - Spacing. Patterns. Repetitive work.  
**You validate** - Does it match Octane SE? Ship or iterate.

**Every step: You lead. AI follows.**

### Debugging Flow

**You diagnose** - "Stack needs systematic verification."  
**You direct** - "AI: Test Octane, check server, verify build."

```bash
# AI executes your directives:
curl http://host.docker.internal:51022  # Octane status
curl http://localhost:43929/api/health  # Server health
npm run build                            # TypeScript check
npm run dev                              # Launch application
```

**AI reports** - Results, errors, status.  
**You decide** - Next strategic move.  
**Loop continues** - Until resolved.

### The Boundary Line

**Tasks for AI:**
- Extract, parse, generate, test, report
- Mechanical, repetitive, systematic work
- Implementation of your specifications

**Tasks for You:**
- Decide, judge, prioritize, strategize
- Creative, unique, uncertain work  
- Definition of what should be built

## 🚀 Velocity: Moving at 3x Speed

**You maintain excellence. AI removes the grind.**

### The Multiplication Effect

**You set standards:**  
TypeScript strict. Real APIs only. Component isolation. Clean commits.

**AI maintains standards:**  
Generates types. Builds components. Scaffolds structure. Executes git ops.

**Result:**  
You focus on decisions. AI handles execution. Quality maintained. Speed tripled.

### Time Comparison

**Without AI: 2 hours**
- Research docs (30 min)
- Write types (20 min)
- Create boilerplate (15 min)
- Wire APIs (20 min)
- Test and debug (30 min)

**With AI: 1 hour**
- You: Specify requirements (5 min)
- AI: Generate implementation (2 min)
- You: Review and refine (20 min)
- AI: Execute adjustments (2 min)
- You: Validate against reference (30 min)

**50% faster. 100% quality. Your standards enforced at AI speed.**

## 🎨 Craft: Where Judgment Meets Execution

**Only you know when it feels right.**

### UI/UX: Your Domain

AI cannot judge:
- Does the spacing feel right?
- Are the animations smooth enough?
- Do the colors match closely enough?
- Does the interaction feel natural?

**Only you can.**

AI can measure:
- Exact pixel spacing from screenshots
- Precise hex color codes from images
- Timing curves from animations
- Interaction sequences from videos

**You judge. AI measures. You decide. AI implements.**

### Quality Flow

**You study** - Octane SE behavior, feel, aesthetic  
**You direct** - "AI: Measure spacing, extract colors"  
**AI reports** - Exact values, precise measurements  
**You specify** - "AI: Implement with these exact specs"  
**AI generates** - Code matching your specifications  
**You validate** - Visual check, feel test, judgment call

### Code Standards

```typescript
// You declare: "Strict typing throughout. No compromises."

// AI implements:
interface NodeData {
  id: number;
  displayName: string;
  category: string;
}
const nodeData: NodeData = response.data;

// You approve or refine
```

**Your standard. AI's execution. Your approval.**

## 🔨 Under Pressure: Strategic Leadership

**Pressure reveals clarity.**

### When Deadlines Loom

**You decide:**
- Core features vs. nice-to-have?
- MVP that delivers value?
- Where to cut without compromising quality?
- Ship 3 perfect features or 10 half-working ones?

**AI executes your call:**
- "AI: Implement these 3 core features first"
- "AI: Generate scaffolding for the rest"
- "AI: Run regression tests on working features"

**You judge under pressure. AI removes the mechanical bottleneck.**

### When Everything Breaks

**You stay calm.** You're the decision-maker.  
**You isolate.** Strategic thinking finds the real problem.  
**You decide.** Experience guides the approach.  
**You prioritize.** Judgment determines what matters.

**AI executes:**
- Runs diagnostics
- Reports findings
- Tests your proposed solutions
- Documents what worked

**Example Flow:**
- **You:** "Octane connection broken. Diagnose systematically."
- **AI:** Tests, checks, verifies, reports
- **You:** "Callback registration blocking event loop. Try lazy init."
- **AI:** Implements, tests, confirms fix
- **You:** "Document in CURRENT_BLOCKER.md. Move on."

**Under pressure: You lead. AI executes. Problems solved.**
