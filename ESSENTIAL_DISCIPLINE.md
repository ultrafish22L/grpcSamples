# ðŸŽ¯ Essential Engineering Discipline
## *Core principles distilled to their essence*

## ðŸ”¥ Three Core Commands

### **FOCUS** 
- Lock scope to exact user request
- Evidence-based approach only
- No scope expansion without permission

### **DEBUG**
- Systematic problem analysis
- Test simplest solution first
- Document solution, not process

### **SHIP**
- Complete working solution
- Test in browser immediately  
- Commit and push when working

## âš¡ Critical Patterns

### **Docker Networking**
```bash
export SANDBOX_USE_HOST_NETWORK=true
# localhost â†’ host.docker.internal for container environments
```

### **Web Development**
```javascript
// Always use cache busting (automatic in OctaneWeb)
// Never rely on F12 - build debug console into app
// Test visual display, not just DOM existence
```

### **Problem Solving**
```xml
<approach>
1. Understand exact problem
2. Try simplest solution first
3. Test immediately
4. Ship when working
</approach>
```

## ðŸš« Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-documentation**: More time writing than coding
- **Complexity creep**: Elaborate solutions for simple problems  
- **Perfectionism**: Delaying shipping for minor improvements
- **Scope drift**: Solving problems not asked for

*"Discipline over cleverness. Evidence over intuition. Focus over completeness."*
