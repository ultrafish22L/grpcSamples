/// Allows the complete export of animated scenes.
///
/// @note This is not supported by all SDK flavours. Check @ref ApiSceneExporter::isSupported()
///     to know whether it is or not.
///
/// Usage:
///     1) Set up initial state of the scene
///     2) Create a new scene exporter and specify the root nodes that should be tracked.
///     3) Loop over all frames you want to export, set each up and call exportSample().
///     4) Call finish().
///     5) Destroy the scene exporter.
///
/// Limitations:
///     - Tracked root nodes must be from the same root node graph.
///     - Tracked root nodes must not be deleted/replaced.
///     - Geometry nodes should not be replaced every frame since the underlying geometry exporter
///       keeps track of them and treats them as new objects. But it 's possible if required.
///     - All other nodes can be replaced, but the node types and node topology must not change
///       since there is no way to store connection changes between frames in .ocs files.
