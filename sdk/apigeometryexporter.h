/// 
/// Exporting geometry
/// ------------------
///
/// Before exporting frames, use addItem() to define which items to export. For geometry nodes,
/// all geometry connected via the inputs of that node are exported as well. In a typical use
/// case, exporting the scene which is currently rendered, only the geometry node connected
/// to the render target needs to be added.
/// 
/// The items passed into addItem() should not be deleted during the export. The geometry 
/// which is connected via the input pins can be disconnected or deleted during the export, 
/// and newly connected geometry will be automatically included.
///
/// ## meshes ##
/// 
/// Mesh nodes should not be deleted and recreated between frames. Otherwise the exporter
/// can't export these mesh nodes as a single moving object. This will slow down loading the
/// exported file and may break vertex motion blur.
///
/// The set of material pins and object layer pins must be constant (i.e. the
/// A_MATERIAL_NAMES and A_OBJECT_NAMES cannot change).
///
/// Note that the names of the material and object inputs will not be exported as material/
/// object layer inputs on the archive. The inputs are defined by the connected nodes.
///
/// ## transforms ##
/// 
/// Transforms may be defined via either scatter nodes or placement nodes. You can use a
/// transform matrix filled with zeros to indicate an instance is invisible in this frame.
/// This can be useful to mark meshes as invisible, or to ensure instances created with a
/// scatter node stay at the same index in that scatter node.
///
/// Sometimes it is necessary to export subframes for a transform node during a frame.
/// To export subframes, pass an interval into the writeFrame() function and assign an
/// animation to the transform node with multiple keyframes within this interval.
///
///
/// Defining the time sampling
/// --------------------------
/// 
/// You should explicitly define the time stamps for the exported frames using
/// writeTimeSampling().
/// 
/// The actual time stamps in the exported nodes will be ignored (and can be set to a
/// fixed interval, eg. [0, 1] or [0, 1/24] if this is more convenient for the plug-in).
/// 
/// Defining the material and object layer inputs
/// ---------------------------------------------
///
/// The material inputs visible on the geometry archive are defined in terms of the material
/// nodes connected to the geometry:
///
///  - all empty material pins will be grouped together into a "Default material" input
///
///  - Connected pins will be grouped together according to their connected node. 
///    This may be either a material node or a linker. Every  distinct node will result
///    in a single input with the same name as that node.
///
///  - If two input nodes have the same name, a number will be appended to one of the
///    names to make them unique.
/// 
/// The object layer inputs are defined in an analogue way.
/// 
/// 
/// Exporting a geometry archive to a scene file (OCS or ORBX)
/// ----------------------------------------------------------
/// 
/// To include the exported Alembic file in a scene file, createGeometryArchive() can be used
/// to create the geometry archive for the exported file.
/// 
/// createGeometryArchive() will try to connect materials and object layer nodes in your scene
/// to the created archive. You should ensure that these nodes are either:
/// 
///   - owned by the input pins of your mesh node. In this case the node will be copied to
///     the input pin on the created archive.
/// 
///   - owned by the same parent node graph as the newly created archive.
/// 
///   - connected via either: an input linker of the parent node graph, or an output linker
///     of another node graph inside the parent graph. In that case that linker node
///     is connected to the archive.
/// 
/// In other cases the material cannot be connected to the archive and the input pin will be
/// left empty. This may happen if for instance both a mesh node and the connected material
/// node are inside a child node graph.
///
/// Later, functions like collectItemTree() or deleteUnconnectedItems() may be used to prune
/// the actual geometry nodes before exporting the scene file.
///
/// @note This is not supported by all SDK flavours. Check @ref ApiGeometryExporter::isSupported()
///     to know whether it is or not.
