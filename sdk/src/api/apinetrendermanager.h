/// API for controlling network rendering. Network rendering works with 1 master
/// (either the standalone or a plugin) and several render nodes (a special build of Octane).
/// Concepts:
/// - network master:
///     A master listens on the network for incoming render node connections. When a render node
///     connects, the master will distribute it some work to do.
/// - network render node:
///     When a render node starts, it tries to connect to a master it received via the command line.
///     The render node will just stop if it cannot connect to the master. All render nodes do is
///     wait for masters to assign them some work. A render node that's working for one master
///     cannot work for another master.
/// - network daemon:
///     The daemons are there for configuration convenience. IN PRINCIPLE WE DON'T NEED A DAEMON
///     FOR NETWORK RENDERING TO WORK. A daemon is a process that runs all the time on the PC where
///     the render node is located. It's like the render node's personal agent. The daemon will:
///         - start a render node telling it to work for a master
///         - stop the render node working for a master
///         - monitor the render node and make sure it hasn't crashed
/// - master discovery (a.k.a. master beacon)
///     This is a thread on the master that broadcasts a periodic beacon message that is picked
///     up by the daemons on the network. When a daemon picks up a master baecon, it will inform
///     the master about the render node it is managing (e.g. it will tell if the render node is
///     still availabe, how many GPUs it has available, ...)
///
/// This API is not thread safe!
