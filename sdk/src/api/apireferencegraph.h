/// The reference graph is a node graph of type GT_REFERENCE that allows loading orbx/ocs file
/// contents inside the graph and exposes corresponding inputs and outputs. In addition, each
/// render target in the referenced orbx/ocs will produce an extra output so that it's geometry
/// can be accessed. Please see the GT_REFERENCE node graph attributes for the basic reference.
///
/// ApiReferenceGraph can be used to obtain the animated bounding boxes when the orbx file
/// was saved with AABB data (e.g. to display in the host application viewport).
/// Usage example:
///
///     // It may be a good idea to store a bounds vector somewhere in the object member variable 
///     // so that it's memory doesn't get reallocated every time we fetch the bounds (e.g. when
///     // current animation frame or time changes).
///
///     std::vector<Octane::AABBF> mAabbs;
///
///     ...
///
///     // Create reference graph
///     Octane::ApiReferenceGraph * referenceGraph =
///         Octane::ApiReferenceGraph::create(Octane::ApiProjectManager::rootNodeGraph());
///
///     // Set orbx path
///     referenceGraph->set(Octane::A_EXTERNAL_REFERENCE_PATH, "path_to_my_orbx.orbx", false);
///
///     // Reference will be loaded during evaluation
///     referenceGraph->evaluate();
///
///     // If orbx has the AABB data, it will be available after the graph is evaluated
///     if (!referenceGraph->hasAabbData())
///     {
///         mAabbs.clear();
///         return;
///     }
///     mAabbs.resize(referenceGraph->totalAabbEntries());
///     // Fill the mAabbs vector with the data
///     referenceGraph->fetchAllBounds(mAabbs.data(), mAabbs.size());
///     // The AABBs can be used for drawing. Make sure to fetch it again if time/frame changes.
///
/// To handle each geometry output of the graph separately, use fetchBoundsForOutput() and 
/// totalAabbEntriesForOutput()
